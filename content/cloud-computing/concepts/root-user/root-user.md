The **root user** of a cloud computing account is the identity that has access to all services and resources available to that account. The root user is typically created when the cloud computing account is first set up, and it is used to initialize the services and settings used by that account.

After this initial setup, it is best practice to not use the root user for everyday tasks, even administrative ones. It is recommended that the root user is only used to create the first limited access users to perform day-to-day maintenance. The root user credentials should be kept safe and only be used for the few account and service management tasks for which it is necessary.
